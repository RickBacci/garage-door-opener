This project uses a raspberryPi with the rasbian os installed.


I installed 2 different Ruby gems: WiringPi and pi_piper to access
the GPIO pins on the pi. A relay and ir distance sensor were attached
to the GPIO pins to monitor whether the door was open or closed, and 
activate the door.


Sinatra was used to create a webpage that would display the status of 
the garage-door, and a button to activate it.

Twitter's bootstrap was used to make the site responsive.
